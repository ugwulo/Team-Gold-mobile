# Team Gold Mobile (Quiz App)

We are now managing this project from here: https://dev.azure.com/DevSecOpsSandbox/Parallex/_boards

## To get started: grrh

- Fork the repository at the top right corner
- Click on clone or download, copy the url you see after clicking on it
- Head to your local machine and create a folder with an appropriate name 
- Right-click anywhere in the folder and choose `git bash here`, automatically git bash will open.
- In your terminal or gitbash do `git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/Team-Gold-Mobile.git` <br>
for me it will look like this
-> `git clone https://github.com/ugwulo/Team-Gold-Mobile.git`
- start your work do ` cd Team-Gold-Mobile` 

Now you need to add an upstream to track changes in the remote repository
- run ` git remote add upstream https://github.com/hngi/Team-Gold-Mobile.git`
- run `git pull upstream development
### Now you need to create a new branch corresponding to what you are working on <br>
example, if you are working on a feature called `Widget` it should be like this ->
- `git checkout -b feat/widget` or `git checkout -b feat/widget-quiz-questions` (use hiphen to seperate different words).

- Make your Contribution, When you are done ->
- run `git add .`
- run `git commit -m "feature: create <whatever-you-did>"`
- run `git push origin feat/widget` remember, it should be the name of the branch you created earlier.
- Go-To github, locate the repository you forked earlier, you will see `compare and pull request` <br> 
click on it and type your message, `click on create pull request`.
- Wait for merge and or get on with another feature.

## Happy Contributing!!
